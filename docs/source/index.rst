How to set up wireless printing on your laptop or computer:

To wirelessly connect your Canon printer, follow these steps:

Step 1: Connect your printer to Wi-Fi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Power on your printer and navigate to the **Set Up** menu.
2. Select **Wireless LAN Setup**.
3. Choose your Wi-Fi network from the list and enter the password.

**Alternative Setup Options:**

Understanding Wi-Fi Connection Types
------------------------------------

Canon printers support two types of wireless connections:

1. **Connecting to an Existing Wi-Fi Network (Recommended)**
   - Ideal if you already have a Wi-Fi network at home or in the office.
   - Ensures your devices remain connected to the same network for seamless printing.

2. **Wireless Direct Mode (Without a Router)**
   - Use this method if you don’t have a Wi-Fi network.
   - Your device connects directly to the printer’s built-in Wi-Fi.

Troubleshooting Common Wi-Fi Printing Issues
--------------------------------------------

Having trouble connecting your printer? Try these fixes:

1. **Printer Not Detected on Network**
   - Restart your Wi-Fi router and printer.
   - Ensure your printer and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.
   - Check if the Wi-Fi light is solid blue (flashing means it's still connecting).

2. **Unable to Install Printer Driver**
   - Download the latest driver from Canon’s support page.
   - Run the installer as Administrator (Right-click > **Run as Administrator**).

3. **Wireless Printing is Slow or Unresponsive**
   - Ensure your router is not overloaded with multiple connected devices.
   - Place the printer closer to the router to improve signal strength.
   - Restart your computer and try printing again.
